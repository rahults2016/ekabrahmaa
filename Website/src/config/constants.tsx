    question: 'How is my program personalized to my unique constitution?',

  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: 'What if I have dietary restrictions or health conditions?',
    answer: 'Our team specializes in working with various health conditions and dietary needs.

  {
    id: 8,
    question: 'Is there ongoing support after my program ends?',
